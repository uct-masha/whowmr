Description: The World Malaria Report is a document that has been released 
    annually by the World Health Organization since 2017. The document includes
    annexes in excel format which this package has converted into a format
    more readily usable in R. For example, a common pattern in the annexes is
    to have a `WHO Region/Country/Area` column which this pattern splits into
    multiple columns so that the user can more easily work with the data.
